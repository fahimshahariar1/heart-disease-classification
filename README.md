# heart-disease-classification

This notebook looks into using various Python-based machine learning and data science libraries in an attempt to build a machine learning model capable to predicting whether or not someone has heart disease based on their medical attributes.

We are going to take the following approach
1. Problem Definition
2. Data
3. Evaluation
4. Features
5. Modelling
6. Experimentation

## 1. Problem Definition: In a statement, Given clinical parameters about a patient, can we predict whether or not they have heart disease?

## 2. Data: 
This data set dates from 1988 and consists of four databases: Cleveland, Hungary, Switzerland, and Long Beach V. It contains 76 attributes, including the predicted attribute, but all published experiments refer to using a subset of 14 of them. The "target" field refers to the presence of heart disease in the patient. It is integer valued 0 = no disease and 1 = disease.
